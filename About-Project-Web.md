# Welcome to Project Web.
Project Web is the InsydeIT project for the InsydeIT website. This is a voluntary project to help make the InsydeIT website better. Join us today.

# Quick facts.
The website is built using the Putti platform. This platform helps us to combine both the power of the website and the productivity of a smartphone and tablet app. The website is built using HTML and CSS.

# Is this for everyone?
